# Modes



## Overview
A mode can be thought of as a viewer app configured to perform a specific task,
such as tracking measurements over time, 3D segmentation, a guided radiological workflow, etc.
Addition of modes enables *application* with many *applications* as each mode become
a mini *app configuration* behind the scene.
