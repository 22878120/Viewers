# Measurement panel

In `Basic Viewer` mode, right panel is the `Measurement Panel`. When you use an annotation tool, a pop up will show up and asks the user if they want to track measurements for the
series on which the annotation was drawn.

If you select `yes`, the series becomes a `tracked series`, and the current drawn measurement and next measurements will get shown up on the measurement panel on the right.

# Deleting a Measurement
A measurement can be deleting by dragging it outside the image in the viewport. You can
take a look at the overview video to see this behavior.


# Jumping to a Measurement
Measurements that appear on the measurement panel are linked directly to their original
tool on the viewport. This enables the user to click on a measurement and the viewport will jump to the slice that the measurement has been drawn. You can
take a look at the overview video to see this behavior.

# Prev/Next Measurement
Measurement navigation inside the top viewport can be used to move to previous and next measurement.
