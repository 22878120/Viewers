# Module: Context

- [Overview](#overview)


<mark>This new module type allows you to connect components via a shared context. You can create a context that two components, e.g. a viewport and a panel can use to synchronize and communicate. An extensive example of this can be seen in the longitudinal modeâ€™s custom extensions.

### Contexts

The `@ohif/viewer` tracks "active contexts" that extensions can use to scope
their functionality. Some example contexts being:

- Route: `ROUTE:VIEWER`, `ROUTE:STUDY_LIST`
- Active Viewport: `ACTIVE_VIEWPORT:CORNERSTONE`, `ACTIVE_VIEWPORT:VTK`

An extension module can use these to say "Only show this Toolbar Button if the
active viewport is a Cornerstone viewport." This helps us use the appropriate UI
and behaviors depending on the current contexts.

For example, if we have hotkey that "rotates the active viewport", each Viewport
module that supports this behavior can add a command with the same name, scoped
to the appropriate context. When the `command` is fired, the "active contexts"
are used to determine the appropriate implementation of the rotate behavior.
