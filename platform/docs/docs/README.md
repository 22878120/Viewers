> ATTENTION! You are looking at the docs for the `OHIF-v3` Viewer (third time is

The [Open Health Imaging Foundation][ohif-org] (OHIF) Viewer is an open source,
web-based, medical imaging viewer. It can be configured to connect to Image
Archives that support [DicomWeb][dicom-web], and offers support for mapping to
proprietary API formats. OHIF maintained extensions add support for viewing,
annotating, and reporting on DICOM images in 2D (slices) and 3D (volumes).

## What's new in `OHIF-v3`

`OHIF-v3` is our second try for a React-based viewer, and is the third version
of our medical image web viewers from the start. The summary of changes include:

- Addition of workflow modes
  - Often, medical imaging use cases involves lots of specific workflows that
    re-use functionalities. We have added the capability of workflow modes, that
    enable people to customize user interface and configure application for
    specific workflow.
  - The idea is to re-use the functionalities that extensions provide and create
    a workflow. Brain segmentation workflow is different from prostate
    segmentation in UI for sure; however, they share the segmentation tools that
    can be re-used.
  - Our vision is that technical people focus of developing extensions which
    provides core functionalities, and experts to build modes by picking the
    appropriate functionalities from each extension.

* Redux store has been removed from the viewer, and a cleaner, more powerful
* Tailwind CSS
* End-to-end test suite

DICOM Viewer which can be easily extended for specific uses. If you find
yourself unable to extend the viewer for your purposes, please reach out via our
[GitHub issues][gh-issues]. We are actively seeking feedback on ways to improve
our integration and extension points.
