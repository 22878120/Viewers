# How To: Documentation Step-by-Step

## Why Gatsby?
Previously we used GitBook to create our documentation; however, after some time the project went closed source and its plugins caused a lot of headache breaking down our documents.

We decided to switch to a more widly known static site generator called `Gatsby`.


It primarily uses markdown, html, css, js, misc. plugins, and configuration to generate high quality, easy to read, and easy to maintain documentation.
